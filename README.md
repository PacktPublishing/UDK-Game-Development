## About the Video Course
	
UDK (Unreal Development Kit) is the free version of the popular and award-winning Unreal Engine 3. A truly powerful tool for game development, there has never been a better time to use it for both commercial and independent game-building projects.

Starting with no prior knowledge of UDK, this course exposes you to the main features of UDK, UnrealScript, and Kismet while showing you how to build a third-person platformer game.

On this journey, you will first learn how to build a level and an area by making use of models and geometry. Following this, you will make full use of Kismet, the Unreal Engine’s visual scripting tool, to create collectibles and a simple checkpoint system. Once the basis of the game has been created, you’ll be ready to dive in to the world of UnrealScript by first setting up its working environment. Next, you will learn how to create custom gameplay behaviors and a camera system. Lastly, you’ll see how to customize your UDK game to replace the default settings with your own main menu, loading screen, and splash screens! By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation in building games which you can use in your own future projects.
